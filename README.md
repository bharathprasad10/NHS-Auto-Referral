# NHS-Auto-Referral
The scope of this project is an automated system which takes queries from patients and schedule their appointment to the right primary care network under the GP services. The aim is to develop an automated system to support the existing manual review process and potentially automated the whole referral process in the future.

Step 1: Run the support_vector_model.py - The code trains the data using support vector machine algorithm

Step 2: Run the NHS_auto_referral.py
Note: Install streamlit packgage and run streamlit using the code "streamlit run NHS_autoreferral.py" in the terminal to open up a new local host browsing site
